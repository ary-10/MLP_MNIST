# MLP MNIST

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for classifying the MNIST dataset using Python and TensorFlow.

## Project Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project builds and trains a neural network to recognize these digits. It uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Implementation of an MLP using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training, validation, and evaluation of the model.
- Visualization of results and metrics.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
